This is my reflection in the practical of IBI1_2024-25.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I handle lots of problems cooperating with my classmate and I feel good to help others.

I don't have any question right now and I will keep learning.
