Question: 
How has the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK changed over time? 
Are they becoming more similar or less similar?

Code starts at line 59 and ends at line 69 in dalys.py.

Discussion: 
The plot shows how DALYs in China and the UK have evolved over time. 
The gap between the two countries is narrowing.
This could be due to healthcare system improvements.
