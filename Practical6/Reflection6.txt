This is my reflection for IBI1 Practical 6:
I think practical 6 is much better than previous practicals because it has more flexibility and more challenges.
Overall this practical isn't to hard and I enjoy discussing with teachers and classmates.
In this practical I learn a bit of usage of numpy and matplotlib, which are very crutial and useful.
I have a sense of accomplishment when I solve each bugs and improve the functions of programs, and we may have better way than AI suggested.
For example, we even print out an animation of our stimulation in spatial_SIR program for fun.
It can also be fun, right?
